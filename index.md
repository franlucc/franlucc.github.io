## About Me

*"A watched loss curve never converges." - Anonymous*

I'm a third year Ph.D. candidate advised by [Arjun Guha](https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} in 
the [Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} at Northeastern University. 
My interests lie at the intersection of NLP, programming languages and systems. I focus on deploying CodeLLMs safely in software applications and 
training CodeLLMs for novel domains.

My work spans a range of settings â€” from low-resource programming languages and robotics to education, 3D modeling, and beyond. I ground my research 
in mechanistic interpretability: the belief that model capabilities emerge from identifiable, analyzable components within the model itself.
